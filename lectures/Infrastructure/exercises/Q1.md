You just started an internship in an IT services company.

Your first task is about maintaining an old version of a product still used by a large customer.
A bug just got fixed in the latest version of the product, and you must fix it in the old version.

You ask where the source code is, and a developer shows you a repository in which the development team makes a single commit each week with the week's work.
The old version is in another repository, which is a copy of the original repository made back when the version was released.

Suggest (1) a better way to handle old versions, (2) a better way to apply bugfixes to these versions, and (3) a process to apply your recommendations starting from the current state.
