You've been hired to modernize a codebase from a 50-year-old company: version control, automated builds, and continuous integration.

One of your colleagues, who is not completely up-to-date with modern practices, asks you three questions:

> Shouldn't we minimize the number of source files, to make it easier to call the compiler on the command line?

> Does adding "continuous integration" mean we no longer need to worry about testing?

> Do I have to do one "commit" each day with my day's work?

Explain to your colleague why the answer is no for all three questions.
