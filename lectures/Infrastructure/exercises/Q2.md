The company you're working in recently hired a new CEO, who wants to improve development using modern methods.
However, this CEO does not have an engineering background, so his suggestions are well-intentioned but not always feasible.

The CEO comes to you with a new suggestion:

> Continuous integration is a good practice. We must adopt it, so that our code never has bugs.
> All branches in all our repositories must use continuous integration, and at the end of each day all branches must pass continuous integration.

Explain to the CEO (1) why his goal is not realistic, (2) why his solution isn't realistic, and (3) what a reasonable compromise could be.
