# Evaluation criteria

- The answers should be based on the definition of continuous integration and on good software development practices


# Suggested solution

1. It is not realistic to have zero bugs in a large software product: one should minimize bugs, but a goal of zero is unlikely never be met. 
2. Asking each branch to pass continuous integration each day is unrealistic since many branches contain work in progress that likely does not work yet.
3. A compromise would be asking that all branches representing a product, such as the main branch and branches for previous versions that are still supported,
   should pass continuous integration. This especially means pull requests to these branches should not be merged if continuous integration fails.
   This does not guarantee a lack of bugs, but it will increase confidence that the shipped products are correct.
