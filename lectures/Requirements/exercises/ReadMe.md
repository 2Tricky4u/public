# Exercises: Requirements

**Preparation for the next lectures**:

You will need to install development tools on your machine for the next lectures.
Please read and follow the prerequisites in the lecture notes for [Infrastructure](../../Infrastructure/) and [Testing](../../Testing).


**Theoretical exercises**:

- [Q1: User stories](Q1.md)
- [Q2: User stories](Q2.md)
- [Q3: Personas](Q3.md)
- [Q4: Personas](Q4.md)


The [solutions](solutions/) are available.


There are no specific exercises on localization, internationalization, accessibility, or ethics.
These subjects are important but ill-suited to small exercises.


**Ideas for your own projects**:

- Define personas for your project
- Write a backlog of user stories for your project
- Translate your project in another language, and get that translation tested by a native speaker
- Internationalize your project for another culture, and get it tested by someone from that culture
- Make your project usable without sound, without a screen, and so on.
- Think of how your project could be used for unethical reasons and how you could avoid that
