- The stories must be specific enough that a developer could think of implementing them


# Suggested solution

> As an HR person, I want to add a new staff member in the database, so that I can pay their salary.

> As an HR person, I want to delete a staff member from the database, so that I don't pay somebody who has quit.

> As a professor, I want to send grades by uploading a single file for a course, so that I don't have to repeat the same action for 100s of students.

> As a professor, I want to send an immediate notification to all students in my course, so that I can warn them about last-minute room or scheduling changes.

> As a student, I want to see a list of all courses, so that I can choose which ones to take.

> As a student, I want to search for courses in a specific area, so that I can see ones that are relevant to me.

> As a student, I want to get a notification when I get a new grade, so that I don't have to look at the app every day just in case.

> As a staff member, I want to see my salary certificates, so that I can declare my taxes.

> As a staff member, I want to change my name, so that I can use my display name rather than my full legal name.
