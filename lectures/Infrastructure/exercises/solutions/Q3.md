# Evaluation criteria

- The answers should be based on good version control and continuous integration practices


# Suggested solution

- Compilation is automated by a build system, so the number of files is not important.
  (The number of files should be chosen based on what the files contain, so that each file relates to one concept)

- Continuous integration can run code analysis and automated tests that developers wrote, but it does not create its own tests.

- Each commit should represent a single logical change, such as a new feature or a bug fix. This is not related with the time it takes to make the change.
  (It's a good idea to commit partial work and push it before going home as a backup, but this should then be squashed before merging)
