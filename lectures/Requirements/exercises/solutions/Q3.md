- The decisions must be justified
- The decisions must make sense, but this is not useful if they do not also have a good justification


# Suggested solution

"Ana" is a good persona. (She could lead to features such as "show a random set of recipes" and "find recipes based on ingredients you have at home")

"Bumi" seems like more of a real concrete person than a persona, he has many details that aren't related to the app, such as doing computer science.
The idea of a "student" persona could be useful, for instance representing users who have a tight budget and who want "meal prep" kinds of recipes.

"Cath" is way too vague to be useful. She needs many more details.
