# Evaluation criteria

- The recommendations should be based on good version control practices
- The recommendations should be realistic, and not only theoretical
  (for instance, it is unrealistic to cut up years' worth of history into commits each corresponding to a single change, even if this would be useful)


# Suggested solution

1. Each old version should be in a branch of the repository, not in another repository
2. Instead of one commit per week, each developer should make one commit per new feature or bug fix
3. The team should create a new branch per version and copy-paste the existing code for that version in the branch, which will create one large commit per version.
   Then, the team can enforce that all developers must use pull requests to merge changes.
   Fixes that need porting to old versions can then done by "cherry picking" the relevant commits.
