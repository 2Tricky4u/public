# Getting a local copy of this repository

Starting from [the third lecture](../lectures/Testing), students need to get a local copy of this repository to do the exercises.

This repository uses Git, which is explained in [the second lecture](../lectures/Infrastructure).

To clone this repository, go to the root folder on GitHub, click on the "Code" button, and GitHub will show you the URL to use for `git clone`.

If you only want to do the exercises locally, cloning the repository is enough.
You can `git commit` your changes locally to keep track of them, and `git pull` in case this repository gets updated.

If you want to propose a change to this repository, start by creating a _fork_ of this repository using GitHub's "fork" button,
then clone that fork locally, not this original repository. Make the changes you want, `git commit` them, and `git push` them.
Then, when looking at your fork's root folder on GitHub, you will see a banner with a button to open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests).
