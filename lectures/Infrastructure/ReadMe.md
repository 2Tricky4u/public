# Infrastructure

> **Prerequisites**: Before following this lecture, you should:
> - Install Git. On Windows, use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) as Git is designed mostly for Linux.
>   On macOS, see [the git documentation](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). On Linux, Git may already be installed, or use your distribution's package manager.
>   If you have successfully installed Git, running `git --version` in the command line should show a version number.
> - Create a GitHub account (you do not have to use an existing GitHub account, you can create one just for this course if you wish)
> - Set up an SSH key for GitHub by following [their documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
> - Tell Git who you are by running `git config --global user.name 'your_name'` with your name and `git config --global user.email 'your_email'` with the e-mail you used for GitHub
> - Choose an editor Git will open to write a summary of your changes with `git config --global core.editor 'your_editor'`, since Git defaults to `vi` which is hard to use for newcomers.
>   On Windows with WSL you can use `notepad.exe`, which will open Windows's Notepad.
>   On macOS you can use `open -e -W -n` which will open a new TextEdit window.
>   On Linux you can use your distribution's built-in graphical text editor, or `nano`.
>
> If you use Windows with WSL, note that running `explorer.exe .` from the Linux command line will open Windows's Explorer in the folder your command-line is, which is convenient.
